# 🏊‍♀️ Women's 50 Free Varsity Cutoff Analysis

This project analyzes high school girls' swim times in the 50-yard freestyle to estimate varsity team cutoff thresholds, identify performance trends, and offer data-driven insights for athletic development.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- 📈 **Goal:** Estimate varsity qualifying times and understand athlete performance across grade levels  
- 📋 **Data:** 50-yard freestyle times from a sample of high school female swimmers (2024-2025 American High School Womens Swim Team)
- 🧮 **Tools Used:** Google Sheets / Excel for calculations, CSV for data storage, GitHub for version control

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Cutoff Time Ranges for Varsity Qualification**  
   Most varsity teams set cutoff times in the **27 to 33-second** range, with more competitive programs closer to **27–29 seconds** and smaller programs near **31–33 seconds**.

2. **Distribution of Freshmen Making Varsity**  
   Around **20–30% of freshmen** who try out make varsity, typically swimming near the upper limit of cutoff times. This shows varsity rosters mostly consist of upperclassmen but remain open to fast freshmen.

3. **Performance Improvement Trends**  
   Swimmers improve their 50 Free times by an average of **1–2 seconds per year**, often enough to move from the cutoff range as freshmen to team leaders by junior year.

4. **Implications for Training and Tryouts**  
   Freshmen aiming for varsity should target swim times of **32 seconds or faster** to be competitive, while coaches can use these ranges to set realistic development goals annually.

## 📊 Data Visualization Overview

This project uses performance data from swimmers to analyze trends and estimate varsity-level qualifying times. Two key visualizations — a **histogram** and a **scatter plot** — support this analysis.

---

### 📈 Histogram: Distribution of Earliest 50-Yard Free Time

The histogram displays the distribution of swimmers’ **earliest 50-yard freestyle times**.  
- The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis shows the number of swimmers in each time range.  
- Most swimmers fall between **30 and 35 seconds**, with a peak around **30–32 seconds**, indicating this is the most common performance band.  
- As swim times increase beyond 35 seconds, the number of swimmers drops, with few recording times above 45 seconds.  
- This produces a **right-skewed distribution**, where the tail stretches toward slower times.  

✅ This visualization helps identify the **range where most varsity-level athletes cluster**, estimate a potential **cutoff time**, and spot **performance outliers**.

---

### ⚡ Scatter Plot: Points vs. Earliest 50-Yard Free Time

This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between each swimmer’s **earliest recorded 50-yard freestyle time** and their **overall performance points**.  
- Each point represents a swimmer: **faster times on the left**, **higher scores near the top**.  
- The plot shows a **clear negative correlation** — as swim times decrease, performance points tend to increase.  
- Swimmers with slower times generally receive fewer points.  

✅ This trend reinforces the idea that **better swim performance directly leads to higher rankings**, making the scatter plot valuable for understanding **performance-based point systems** and identifying **top-performing athletes**.

---

### 🟪 Box Plot: Time Distribution by Grade

The box plot displays how swim times are **distributed** for each grade level (Freshman through Senior).
- Each box shows the **middle 50%** for swimmers in that grade.
- The horizontal line in the box is the **median time**.
- Outliers are shown as individual points outside the whiskers
- Upperclassmen, especially juniors and seniors, show **lower medians and narrower boxes**, indicating stronger and more consistent performance.  

✅ This plot is ideal for **comparing time ranges and medians** across grades, showing both **typical performance and consistency** within each class.

---

### 📉 Line Chart: Progression of Average 50 Free Times by Grade

The line chart tracks the **average 50-yard freestyle time** across grade levels to **highlight improvement over time.**
- A downward slope indicates **swimmers get faster each year**
- This trend reflects **natural improvements** from training, experience, and physical development
- Steeper drops between grades show where the most progress is made — often **between Sophomore and Senior years**

✅ This visualization helps set **grade-level benchmarks, track annual improvement, and guide long-term training goals** for both swimmers and coaches
