## 📊 Project Overview
- 📈 **Goal:** Estimate varsity qualifying times and understand athlete performance across grade levels
- 📋 **Data:** 50-yard freestyle times from a sample of high school female swimmers
- 🧮 **Tools Used:** Google Sheets / Excel for calculations, CSV for data storage, GitHub for version control

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Typical Varsity Cutoff Times by Grade Level**  
- Freshmen cutoff times generally fall between **30 to 33 seconds**, improving to **27 to 29 seconds** by juniors and seniors, showing steady performance gains through high school.

2. **Cutoff Time Ranges for Varsity Qualification**  
- Most varsity teams set cutoff times in the **27 to 33-second** range, with more competitive programs closer to **27–29 seconds** and smaller programs near **31–33 seconds**.

3. **Distribution of Freshmen Making Varsity**  
- Around **20–30% of freshmen** who try out make varsity, typically swimming near the upper limit of cutoff times, indicating varsity rosters mostly consist of upperclassmen but remain open to fast freshmen.

4. **Performance Improvement Trends**  
- Swimmers improve their 50 Free times by an average of **1–2 seconds per year**, often enough to move from the cutoff range as freshmen to team leaders by junior year.

5. **Implications for Training and Tryouts**  
- Freshmen aiming for varsity should target swim times of **32 seconds or faster** to be competitive, while coaches use these cutoff ranges to set realistic development goals annually.
