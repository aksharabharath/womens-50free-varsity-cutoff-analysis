# 🏊‍♀️ Women's 50 Free Varsity Cutoff Analysis
This project analyzes high school girls' swim times in the 50-yard freestyle to estimate varsity team cutoff thresholds, identify performance trends, and offer data-driven insights for athletic development.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- 📈 **Goal:** Estimate varsity qualifying times and understand athlete performance across grade levels
- 📋 **Data:** 50-yard freestyle times from a sample of high school female swimmers - (add more info; same year, same high school, which competetions, etc?)
- 🧮 **Tools Used:** Google Sheets / Excel for calculations, CSV for data storage, GitHub for version control

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Cutoff Time Ranges for Varsity Qualification**  
- Most varsity teams set cutoff times in the **27 to 33-second** range, with more competitive programs closer to **27–29 seconds** and smaller programs near **31–33 seconds**.

2. **Distribution of Freshmen Making Varsity**  
- Around **20–30% of freshmen** who try out make varsity, typically swimming near the upper limit of cutoff times, indicating varsity rosters mostly consist of upperclassmen but remain open to fast freshmen.

3. **Performance Improvement Trends**  
- Swimmers improve their 50 Free times by an average of **1–2 seconds per year**, often enough to move from the cutoff range as freshmen to team leaders by junior year.

4. **Implications for Training and Tryouts**  
- Freshmen aiming for varsity should target swim times of **32 seconds or faster** to be competitive, while coaches use these cutoff ranges to set realistic development goals annually.


📊 Data Visualization Overview

This project uses performance data from swimmers to analyze trends and estimate varsity-level qualifying times. Two key visualizations—a histogram and a scatter plot—are used to support this analysis.

📈 Histogram: Distribution of Earliest 50-Yard Free Time

The histogram displays the distribution of swimmers’ earliest 50-yard freestyle times. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis shows how many swimmers fall into each time range. Most swimmers fall between 30 and 35 seconds, with a noticeable peak around 30–32 seconds, indicating this is the most common performance band. As swim times increase beyond 35 seconds, the frequency of swimmers decreases sharply, with only a few athletes recording times above 45 seconds. This creates a right-skewed distribution, where the tail stretches toward slower times. The histogram is useful for identifying the range where most varsity-level athletes cluster, estimating a possible cutoff time, and spotting outliers in performance.


⚡ Scatter Plot: Points vs. Earliest 50-Yard Free Time

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between each swimmer’s earliest recorded 50-yard freestyle time and their overall performance points. Each point represents a swimmer, with faster times on the left and higher scores near the top. The plot reveals a clear negative correlation—as swim times decrease (indicating faster swimmers), the points awarded tend to increase. Swimmers with slower times generally receive lower points. This trend supports the idea that better swim performance directly contributes to higher point totals, making the chart valuable for understanding performance-based rankings and identifying top-performing athletes.
