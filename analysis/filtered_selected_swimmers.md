### 🧪 Varsity Participant Analysis – Findings
Overview
This analysis compares the **estimated varsity cutoff time** with the actual varsity participants based on early-season 50-yard freestyle times.

### Team Snapshot
Total swimmers in dataset: 53
Confirmed varsity participants: 20
Estimated varsity cutoff (Top 30%): **31.99 seconds**

### ⏱ Time-Based Comparison
| Criteria                                 | Count | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Varsity swimmers ≤ 31.99s (met cutoff)   | 13    | 72.2%      |
| Varsity swimmers > 31.99s (above cutoff) | 5     | 27.8%      |

Fastest varsity time: **27.40s**

Slowest varsity time: **36.26s**

### 📌 Key Takeaways
The estimated cutoff (31.99s) is a strong predictor — capturing the majority of varsity swimmers.
Not all varsity selections are based strictly on time. Several swimmers with slower times likely qualified due to:
- Event specialization (e.g., strokes other than freestyle)
- Relay team needs
- Grade level or team experience
- Coach discretion
