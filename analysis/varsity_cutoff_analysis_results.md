# Varsity Cutoff Analysis Results

## Overview
This analysis estimates the varsity swim team cutoff time and evaluates how many freshmen meet this cutoff.

---

## Varsity Cutoff Time
- Estimated varsity cutoff (top 30% of swimmers): **31.99 seconds**

---

## Freshmen Qualification
- Total freshmen in dataset: **13**
- Freshmen at or under cutoff time: **4**
- Percentage of freshmen qualifying for varsity: **30.8%**

---

## Key Observations
- Approximately 31% of freshmen meet or beat the varsity cutoff time, which aligns with the top 30% cutoff threshold.
- This indicates that freshmen swimmers have a competitive representation on varsity.
- Additional analysis is recommended for other classes (sophomores, juniors, seniors) to compare qualification rates.
- The cutoff time provides a reasonable benchmark for predicting varsity eligibility.

## Next Steps
- Analyze cutoff qualification across all grade levels for a comprehensive team overview.
- Visualize qualification percentages by class year.
- Integrate findings into a GitHub project for easy access and reproducibility.
